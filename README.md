# Multi-agent structural health monitoring system 
Title: 
Design and implementation of a multi-agent-based structural health monitoring system for civil infrastructure.
Objective: 
• Develop a multi-agent system (MAS) tailored for civil infrastructure structural health monitoring (SHM), addressing challenges in real-time data collection, fault detection, and system scalability.
Key Aspects:
• Sensor Node Configuration: Integrated Adafruit BNO085 IMU for motion sensing, Adafruit BME280 is used to monitor humidity, pressure, and temperature, and ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 is used for efficient data processing.
• Multi-Agent System (MAS) Implementation: Developed and deployed a MAS on a Raspberry Pi, utilizing MQTT for IoT-based data transfer and implementing agents on JADE for agent-based decision-making and coordination.
• Methodology: Applied the AGEME methodology to design and simulate multi-agent interactions within the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system.
Outcome: 
• Evaluate MAS’s efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in SHM, offering insights for real-world infrastructure monitoring integration.
